# Abundables!

## An easy to use alternative to AssetBundles and Addressables in Unity.

Abundables strikes an easy medium between bare AssetBundles
and overcomplicated Addressables. You have decent control
over your Bundles with just a few clicks.

Click the `Abundables/Open Editor` menu item to open the editor.

From there, you can create/delete Bundles, add/remove Assets from Bundles, set Runtime Addresses, and build your Bundles.

If for whatever reason you need access to the underlying data, It's located at `Assets/Abundables/Editor/Data/AbundableData`.
